“Try to leave this world a little better than you found it,” said [Robert Baden-Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell). Based on this philosophy, I would like to use my talents to make AI beneficial and safe, and to reduce the risks associated with it.

I started my ML journey as part of a project on Twitter disinformation, which led to publications at EMNLP 2024. During this time, I worked commercially and also tried interdisciplinary projects, ultimately deciding on AI Safety.
My goal is to do research that informs public policy - evaluations, data, and recommendations that decision-makers can use.

Privately, I assume that you guessed after the first quote, I am a scout leader. And I will be honest - I gain an incredible amount of energy from engaging people in **good** things.
